Weather Report application
This is a simple Python project that fetches and displays real-time weather data for a given city using the OpenWeatherMap API.
Users can enter a city name, and the program will show the current temperature, humidity, pressure, and weather description.
It is a beginner-friendly application demonstrating the use of APIs, HTTP requests, and JSON data handling in Python.
